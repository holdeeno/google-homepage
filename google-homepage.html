	<h1>Hi there</h1>

	<!-- To-Do 
		
		-use flexbox / grid to create the outline. Use normal colored boxes or something so I can get an idea for the layout. Maybe watch a tutorial on how people use flexbox / grid to set up the firefram of their websites.
		-Compile all of the images off of Google's homepage (the main logo, the 'images', 'videos', 'search' tag, etc.). I should be able to grab these from the actual homepage by using 'inspect', and then downloading the files directly from the HTML. 
		-Put all of these files in a 'resources' file in the same directory as the HTML and CSS code
		-Create the search box, and use CSS to round the corners, add the appropriate shadow, make it the correct size, center it with the google logo, etc.
		-Add all of the text in the footer (I actually think that all of the text is probably just styled HTML, so just make sure I get the font-family and color right.)
		-Add effects to the box so it changes when you click on it
